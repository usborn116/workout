A workout generator created in React! You tap the button that corresponds with the workout you want to do, and you'll get the number of sets, number of reps, and workout type for each of 6 workouts for you to do.

I used this repo for help with getting this React app to work on GH Pages: https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages
